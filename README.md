## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [dnd-kit](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Drag and drop functionality
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS build tool
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  - How to add drag and drop functionality 
  - Adding themes to the website using Tailwind
  - Writing a cleaner code when it comes to derivative state

### Continued development

  - Improve Drag and Drop Styles.
  - Using useEffect() to update the local items List whenever it changes instead of doing it manually.
